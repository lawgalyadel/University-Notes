<p2> Foundations Of Physics </p2>
</div>
<p> This module provides foundational physics knowledge necessary for progression to Level 2, covering essential topics such as wave phenomena, electromagnetism, Newtonian mechanics, quantum mechanics, special relativity, and optics. Emphasis is placed on group discussions of scientific concepts to bridge the gap between A-level and university-level physics and to develop core study skills. The module also includes practice in problem-solving, synthesizing and analyzing new problems, and coding to model physical systemsâ€”skills essential for further studies in physics. </p>
