<h1> University Notes </h1>
<div id="p1">
<p> Hello! I am a Durham University student who is studying Natural Sciences. I am focusing on Physics and Computer Science modules. For one of my Computer Science modules, I have to study HTML and CSS so as a way to revise and practice my coding skills I have made this website and I will use it to store my Lecture Notes. This might be of help to you or not but thank you for checking it out anyways! ☺️ </p>

<p> Hello! I am Adel. As I said I am a First Year student at Durham studying Natural Sciences. I am hoping to do a 4 year course and Inshallah end up with a MSc in either Maths and Computer Science or Physics and Computer Science. I started this website to build a portfolio and to track my growth and development in HTML and coding which I will try do more independent projects with. While you're here you may aswell connect with my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/adel-lawgaly-695ab12a3/" target="_blank"> LinkedIn </a>  so I can make my way to TRIPLE DIGIT CONNECTIONS. Thank you again for looking at this and if you want to leave any feedback there's a form below that directly links to my email. </p>
