<p> Hello! I am a Durham University student who is studying Natural Sciences. I am focusing on Physics and Computer Science modules. For one of my Computer Science modules, I have to study HTML and CSS so as a way to revise and practice my coding skills I have made this website and I will use it to store my Lecture Notes. This might be of help to you or not but thank you for checking it out anyways! ☺️ </p>
